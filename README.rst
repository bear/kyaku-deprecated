kyaku
=====

In Japanese kyaku means (according to the google searches I did) one of the
following: guest, customer, visitor and/or client

I couldn't think of a better project name for something that will help unify
the social media interactions (ala Twitter) with back-end (aka stable ;) tools
like mailing lists.

So, kyaku is a set of tools to monitor social media and mailing lists and
bridge the them.

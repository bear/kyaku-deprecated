Introduction
------------
In Japanese kyaku means (according to the google searches I did) one of the
following: guest, customer, visitor and/or client

I couldn't think of a better project name for something that will help unify
the social media interactions (ala Twitter) with back-end (aka stable ;) tools
like mailing lists.

So, kyaku is a set of tools to monitor social media and mailing lists and
bridge the them.

Getting the Code
----------------
The code is hosted at _GitHub: http://github.com/bear/kyaku and is, for the most part,
a Python project.  I've aimed to keep it v2.7+ compatible with an eye towards v3 also.

::
  git clone git://github.com/bear/kyaku.git

Installing
----------
There are many moving parts that need to be configured when installing kyaku
into a server environment, details can be found in the INSTALL document.

Dependencies
